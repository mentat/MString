MString & MStringArray - Dynamic string data type library
Copyright (C) 2000 Jesse L. Lovelace

.1BETA - Initial release as GString.

.2BETA (non-released) - Name changed to MString to avoid imcompatibilty
      with gtk+ (which has a GString data type).

.3 - * Recursive rewrite of Reverse()
     * Rewrote many functions to improve speed and decrease mem usage
	 * Added MNode * tailMNode to MString object.  Concatination
        speed increased greatly. Size increased by sizeof(MNode*)
     * Header file cleaned up a little.
	 * Input operators accually work now. :(
	 * testG() now reports head and tail node pointers

.3.1 - * Additional header file documentaion added, more information on
          each function included.

0.3.2 - * Added char& operator [](int nIndex) function with allows []
          access at lefthand value (you can set the char using [], CString
          does not allow this)
        * Added char* ToChar() which returns a pointer to a character string
          containing a copy of the contents in the MString object.
        * Added Split() function to MStringArray.
	* Added ToInt();
	* Find() rewritten for speed.
	* "char string[]" notation removed, all char strings are now 
	   "char* string"
	* Replace() rewritten for speed.
	* SpanExcluding & SpanIncluding rewritten for speed.

0.5.0 - * Changed a bunch of stuff and I hope it all still works. :)
	* First release of MStringArray (BETA 1)

0.50a - * Included a configure script (need feedback on if this works
	well).

0.60  - * I'm back from the summer!!!  Fixed varius bugs and am working on 
	new features.  Thanks to: Sven Dawitz, Sean Rae, & Shaohui Yan
	for their bug reports.
	* Fixed (hopefully) insert() bug.
	* You can now do '+' with integers.
	* Other misc bugfixes.
