Installation

The simplest way to compile this package is:

(Note, you do not need to install MString to use it, you can simply copy
the header and source files from the src directory to the directory of
your source code)

  1. Type `./configure' to configure the package for your system.  If 
     you're using `csh' on an old version of System V, you might need 
	 to type `sh ./configure' instead to prevent `csh' from trying to 
	 execute `configure' itself.

     Running `configure' takes awhile.  While running, it prints some
     messages telling which features it is checking for.

  2. Type `make' to compile the package.

  3. Optionally, type `make check' to run any self-tests that come with
     the package.

  4. Type `make install' to install the programs and any data files and
     documentation.

  5. You can remove the program binaries and object files from the
     source code directory by typing `make clean'.  To also remove the
     files that `configure' created (so you can compile the package for
     a different kind of computer), type `make distclean'.

'make install' will put libMString.a and libMStringArray.a in your
lib directory (/usr/local/lib on my FreeBSD machine).  MString.h and
MStringArray.h will go in the include directory (/usr/local/include on
mine).  
 
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Using MString

To use the MString library you must add the -l flag to your gcc compatible
compiler (I don't know the link command on other compilers).

ie:  g++ -o MyProg MyProg.o -lMString
     (to access MString)
--or--
     g++ -o MyProg MyProg.o -lMStringArray
     (to use MString and MStringArray)

Some unix flavors do not find the libraries in /usr/local/lib/.  To solve
this you need to either add /usr/local/lib/ to your library search path or
copy libMString.a and libMStringArray.a from /usr/local/lib/ to /usr/lib/,
also copy MString.h and MStringArray.h from /usr/local/include/ to
/usr/include/.

In addition you can edit the Makefile in the src directory and change the
line that says 'prefix' to /usr/lib/ instead of /usr/local/lib
